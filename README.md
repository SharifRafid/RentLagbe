# RentLagbe

An open source rental project.

// This is my first read me file so I'm not sure how it works . Thanks For Understanding.

So this project will basically be an Android App or Maybe even IOS if there are developers available.

This will have a nice structured database and backend. I still don't know what we should use as the admin panel or backend or
maybe use another app as an admin panel and firebase as backend. But I'm open for suggestions.

Work flow of the app/project : 

Basically it'll be like Bikroy or Bproperty (Kind of) but not exactly the same. 

People going in will be able to login/sign up via some methods of security. Then the home page will appear which will be like :
It'll have list of houses/stores/shops etc for rent which the user can select and see details of it and images also contact number.

The top bar will have some options to select Division>District>Upazila and query through the ads/rents . Also there will be a search
function for better ux. Basically it'll have all the necessary features a rental app actually needs.

Then there'll be another option for posting a rental or ad and the ads will not get shown straight up to the main app. But they will remain 
in a pending approval system and then when they are approved by the admins then they will be shown. 

Now there's going to be an admin panel for managing everything and also the ads approval and stuff like that.

My current thought is making two different android apps one for admin and one for user and connect them both via firebase backend.
But I think a web based system might be better. 

So I'm open for suggestions guys.


Also note that this project is totally open source and anyone can use it as they want to.

THANK YOU <3
